  description: "# Optional_Motion Light Switch Blueprint Automation V 1.2\n
    Is my take on Light Profiles with Automations. This version has the following profiles;\n
    - Bright      - (For Day time & Events, I need to be Awake; Bright eyed & bushy tailed).\n
    - Dimmed      - (For after sunset & before sunrise when i'm (still) thinking about bed, but I will want to be able to read the Funny pages).\n
    - Night-Light - (For bed/sleep time, & you don't want to wake  everyone else up, but you still want to see in an emergency; how to get to the Fridge)\n
    - Colour-Loop -  (Was to be Aurora-Australis, but colour-loop is easier to remember).\n
    - Circadian   -  (For the rest of the house at night, & to get everyone in sync @ night with you).\n
    - Adaptive    -  (This works really well with a bed/sleep input_boolean).\n
    - Random      -  (A Sorely missed replacement to the light effect).\n
    - Custom      -  (Used for applying custom colour effects, it only has the Transition effect).\n
    - Themed      -  (Theme different rooms, with different colours).\n
    - Flash       -  (works great in conjunction with Alarm Panel Automations).\n
    - Arora       -  (My Aurora-Australis that I wanted when I first started).\n
    - None        -  (Utilise this when using scenes & if you need to disable the light.turn_on Service Call).\n
    - '.'         -  (for advanced users to halt this script).\n\n
    \    - A [PREREQUISITE] of an input_select { Dropdown } with the desired above Profile/s (words) added is required { recommend one for each instance of this Automation }. \n
    \    - A [PREREQUISITE] of another input_select { Dropdown } with the (words) 'On' 'Off' & 'Auto' ( 'Auto' if you include a motion sensor ) added is required { recommend one for each instance of this Automation }. \n
    \    - A [OPTIONAL] input_boolean { Toggle } is Available for Adaptive Profile Night-Light to work { recommend just the one, that will do }.\n
    \    - A [OPTIONAL] binary_sensor, Device_class: motion. Is Available for the 'Auto' Switch feature { or at-least I am trying to make it so }.\n
    \    - & I'm assuming you already have some Lights that you wanted to add.\n\n
    Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers > Create Helper > { Dropdown } &or { Toggle }.\n
    Replace 'Optional_Motion' in the name of this script with the name of room/area/device/entity  ( E.g. Office ) light/s, this script is intended to turn_on [for convenience]."
